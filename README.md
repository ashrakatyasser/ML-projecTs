🎯 Rock vs Mine Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses Machine Learning to classify sonar signals as either Rock or Mine (Metal Cylinder).
It is a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates the full ML workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

📂 Dataset

Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/151/connectionist+bench+sonar+mines+vs+rocks) – Sonar Dataset
The dataset contains 208 samples.

Each sample has 60 features (sonar signal readings).

Target variable:
R → Rock
M → Mine

⚙️ Project Workflow:
1- Importing Libraries
2- Loading the Dataset
3- Data Exploration & Preprocessing
4- Splitting into Train & Test sets
5- Training a Machine Learning Model (Logistic Regression)
6- Model Evaluation using Accuracy Score
7- Making Predictions on New Data

📊 Results
Achieved ~83-86% accuracy on the test dataset.
