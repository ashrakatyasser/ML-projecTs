🎯 Rock vs Mine Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses Machine Learning to classify sonar signals as either Rock or Mine (Metal Cylinder).
It is a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates the full ML workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

📂 Dataset
